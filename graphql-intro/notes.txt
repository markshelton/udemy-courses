Review of REST-ful routing
- Uniform URL & HTTP request methods used to access a server's records
  e.g. POST /<object> - Create a record
  e.g. GET - /<object> - Fetch all records
  e.g. GET - /<object>/:id - Fetch record with given id
  e.g. PUT - /<object>/:id - Update record with given id
  e.g. DELETE - /<object>/:id - Delete record with given id
- Nested records e.g. /<object1>/:id1/<object2>/:id2
  --> Queries get complicated
  --> May involve lots of requests
  --> May over-fetch record details

  What is GraphQL?
  - Maps relational database to graph 
  - Queries look like:
    query {
      user(id: "23") {
        friends {
          company {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }

Passport & GraphQL
- GraphQL is the mediator of a lot of other services
