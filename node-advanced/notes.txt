1. Javascript Code We Write
2. Node - Javascript
 - argument checking, error handling
 - process.binding()  - imports C++ code
3. Node - C++
 - V8 - translation layer between Javascript and C++
 - libuv - interface with OS, concurrency

Process - instance of a running program
Thread - pipeline of operations (process can have multiple)

Handling multiple threads
    1. Add more cores to the CPU
    2. Inspect thread instructions and interleave

Node Event Loop -> Single Threaded
Some of Node Framework / Standard Library -> Not Single Threaded

libuv manages thread pool
    - 4 threads by default
    - process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE

Can we use the threadpool for personal JS Code? Yes!
What functions in node stdlib use threadpool? fs + some crypto
How does threadpool fit into event loop? Through pendingOperations

Improving Node Performance
    - Use Node in 'Cluster' Mode - Recommended
    - Use Worker Threads - Experimental
